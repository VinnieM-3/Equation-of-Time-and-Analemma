# Equation of Time and Analemma Interactive Graphing Tool
Simple Python application to observe effects of obliquity, eccentricity, and the angle between the solstice (winter in northern hemisphere) and perihelion on the equation of time and analemma.  The sliders can be used to vary the obliquity, eccentricity, and solstice/perihelion angle.

Requires: Python (tested on 2.7 and 3.7), numpy, and matplotlib.  Copy eot.py and eot_gui.py to the same folder and run eot_gui.py (i.e. "python eot_gui.py").  *Tip: If your computer isn't very fast, try clicking on the sliders instead of dragging your mouse along them.*
